Qt + Vulkan Nbody Demo

This is a Qt program that uses the Vulkan API to render a classical N-body simulation. Both graphics and compute shaders are employed. Graphical enhancements include bloom and high dynamic range rendering (hdr).

The program draws inspiration and uses some code from the following examples and tutorials, which I would recommend to anyone wanting to learn: 
Niko Kauppi's Vulkan tutorials on Youtube (https://youtu.be/wHt5wcxIPcE). 
Sascha Willems' Vulkan examples on Github (https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan).
